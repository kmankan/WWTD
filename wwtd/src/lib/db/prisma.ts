// A note on global
// you can add ANY properties you want to global! 
// It's like a big shared object that you can add stuff to:


// global is a built-in Node object that exists across the entire application and reloads
// we create a typescript type reference for the global object
// TypeScript's type definition for the global object doesn't include our prisma property by default, 
// so we need to tell TypeScript "trust us, this will exist".
const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient | undefined }
// start with the global object, and make a new variable that points to it
// with particular type information
// step 1: remove all type information with unknown
// step 2: Add new type 'as { prisma: PrismaClient | undefined }'
// This means the global object has a key CALLED 'prisma' that contains a PrismaClient
 
 
// the first time this file runs, globalForPrisma is null, 
// so a new PrismaClient will be created and assigned to prisma;
// the next time it runs, it will find the existing global object and utilise that

  log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
    ? ['query', 'error', 'warn']    // Log everything in development
    : ['error']                     // Only log errors in production
})   
// this is the same as global.prisma
// go into the object globalForPrisma, and look for the prisma key
// assign the value of the key (i.e. the PrismaClient) as a variable prisma OR
// assign a new PrismaClient to the variable prisma

 
// we assign the prisma client to the global object above
// no hot reloading in prod, so we dont have to worry about it
